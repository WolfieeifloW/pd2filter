![03](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/40577712/110861656-72eb7d00-828c-11eb-80f0-2d586bb2773c.png)

![In-Game Settings](https://i.imgur.com/WFeroFv.png)
1. Close the Settings window by right-clicking in the title bar (anywhere along the bar that says "Settings")
1. Reload your filter using **Numpad 0**
   1. If you don't have a numpad change `Reload Config:          VK_NUMPAD0` in ProjectDiablo.cfg (in your PD2 folder) to one of these [Virtual Key Codes](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/inputdev/virtual-key-codes)

If it worked a Minor Health Potion should now say *HP1*.

# Loot Filters
### [Detailed](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/WolfieeifloW/pd2filter/main/detailed.filter)  
CTRL+click the above link for the raw code.  
**Select this version if you are uncomfortable with needing to write your own filter lines.** This version has lines for every single item in the game and is **massively** commented to make it very, very easy to edit to your liking. This is for ease-of-use and very quick editing as you should ideally only ever have to comment or uncomment a line (add or remove //). This version will show and notify a lot of items by default with the idea that you can slowly start to comment out things you don't need. The flip side is that since this filter contains lines for every item you can easily just uncomment a line for things you want to show that aren't currently showing.

### [Compact](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/WolfieeifloW/pd2filter/main/compact.filter)  
CTRL+click the above link for the raw code.  
**Select this version if you are comfortable with writing your own filter lines.** This version will contain only the lines that are already uncommented in the Detailed version. This version will still show and notify a lot of items that you can slowly start to comment out but you have to have knowledge of filters to add your own lines for items that are not already in the filter.

### [Wolfie](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/WolfieeifloW/pd2filter/main/wolfie.filter)  
CTRL+click the above link for the raw code.  
**This version is a copy of my own personal filter.** It is semi-strict while still working while leveling. No support will be given for this filter. Please only report items that are completely wrong.

### [BTNeandertha1](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/WolfieeifloW/pd2filter/main/btneandertha1.filter)  
CTRL+click the above link for the raw code.  
This is a custom-made version for [BTNeandertha1](https://www.twitch.tv/btneandertha1) which is quite strict. No support will be given for this version.

### [Template](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/WolfieeifloW/pd2filter/main/template.filter)  
CTRL+click the above link for the raw code.  
**Select this version if you want a template/base to start from for creating your own filter.** This filters purpose is to help people get a start on building their own filter. No support will be given for this filter, you assume all responsibility for creating and editing it to your liking.

# Common Issues
These are the common problems that people seem to run into. Please check each of these before asking for help.
* In-game settings not matching what I have in [Installation](https://github.com/WolfieeifloW/pd2filter#installation)
* Having two PD2 installations and pasting your filter into the wrong one
* Saving the filter file with the wrong name, eg **default.filter.filter**, **default.txt**, or **default.filter.txt**
* Having a PD2 installation inside of a Diablo II folder which is inside another Diablo II folder (folderception!)
* Not saving and closing the filter file after pasting into it

# FAQ
* **Will a loot filter from Season 1 work for Season 2?**
  * No. Season 2 added new items, changed all the map item codes, and more. You will most likely miss out on all of these things if you continue using a Season 1 filter
* **What is the best / recommended filter (or for leveling)?**
  * "Best" / "recommended" is subjective. The best/recommended filter is the filter that suits your needs! Check channel pins for wiki or just try a few different ones out. It's easier than ever now to try different ones as it's a few clicks in the launcher
* **But I've customized my filter, how do I save my changes?**
  * Put your customized filter into `ProjectD2\filters\local` and choose "Local" in the launcher
* **My launcher still says "Coming soon!" for item filters?**
  * Visit the [Project Diablo 2](https://www.projectdiablo2.com/) site and download the launcher and install again
* **My launcher shows no filters in the list?**
  * Close launcher and re-open, repeat if they still don't show - *or* the server/GitHub is down
* **Has anyone made a video or post about the differences between X and Y filter?**
  * No one here has made comparison videos or a post of "X vs Y filter", that would be an astronomical amount of work. What's not a lot of work is trying a few out and seeing what fits your style
* **How can I test my chosen loot filter?**
  * The easiest way to test your filter is on Single Player with the [PlugY Pack](https://projectdiablo2.miraheze.org/wiki/PD2_Item_Pack) or by using [BetweenWall's FilterBird](https://betweenwalls.github.io/filterbird/?v=PD2)
* **Are your filters updated for Season 2?**
  * Yes, all versions of my filters are updated and ready-to-go for Season 2!
* **What is the difference between your filters?**
  * My Detailed/Compact are non-strict, Wolfie is strict(er), and BT is strictest
